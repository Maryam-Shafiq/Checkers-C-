# Checkers Game

This is a simple implementation of a Checkers game in C++. The game allows two players to play a classic game of Checkers on an 8x8 board.

## Features

- Basic Checkers gameplay
- King pieces that can move backward
- Player vs. Player mode

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Maryam-Shafiq/Checkers-C-.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Checkers-C-
    ```

3. Compile the game:

    ```bash
    g++ -o Checkers Checkers.cpp
    ```

4. Run the game:

    ```bash
    ./Checkers
    ```

## Usage

- The game will prompt each player to enter the position of their piece and the direction they want to move.
- The directions are:
  - 1: Upper Left
  - 2: Upper Right
  - 3: Lower Left
  - 4: Lower Right
- The game will continue until one player has no pieces left or no valid moves.
